"""http_transport.py — a page, fetched without a browser.

Why this exists
===============
A Snapchat profile page is server-rendered whole: its `__NEXT_DATA__`
carries the account, its story, its highlights and its Spotlight videos,
and it was served to a bare HTTP client from a datacentre address with no
key and no cookies (measured 2026-09-24, 30 of 30 in a row). A browser on
that route costs a Chromium start and buys nothing — measured three
accounts end to end, median of three runs: 1.29 s over HTTP against
3.14 s through a browser, identical rows.

What this is NOT
================
Not a replacement for the browser engines. It is the DEFAULT where a route
does not challenge, and the browser is what `--transport auto` falls back
to the moment one does — because an HTTP client has nowhere to put a
solved token, no cookie jar a challenge issuer will accept, and no DOM. On
Snapchat that fallback is insurance rather than routine: no refusal has
been observed.

The interface is the one `_BrowserSession` already presents, so everything
above the transport in an engine is unchanged: `get_text`, `post_json`,
`goto`, `content`, `count_selector`, `evaluate`, `url`, `close`.
