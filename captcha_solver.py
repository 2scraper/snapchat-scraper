captcha_solver.py
------------------
Shared helper used by all three scrapers (Playwright / Selenium / Puppeteer).

Detection runs after EVERY page navigation in the main loop of all three
scrapers, regardless of what URL was requested — this is deliberate, not
scoped to any one page, because which challenge a visitor meets depends on
the exit and on what the address has been doing.

WHAT THIS MODULE IS FOR ON SNAPCHAT
-----------------------------------
**Readiness, not routine — and a configured captcha nobody has met.**

From a bare datacentre address with no key and no proxy, Snapchat
rendered no captcha on any page (measured 2026-09-24, 26 served captures,
zero occurrences of even the word `captcha`). But "no challenge rendered"
is NOT "no captcha configured" (CLAUDE.md §18): the profile page's own
Content-Security-Policy permits scripts from `www.google.com/recaptcha`,
`hcaptcha.com` and `*.hcaptcha.com`. So a refusal here, if one comes, is
likeliest to carry one of those two.

This module implements reCAPTCHA (v2, v3, enterprise), Cloudflare
Turnstile and hCaptcha.

The machinery below — the `turnstile.render` interception, the enterprise
task types, the variant heuristic — is family core. It is here so that a
route which starts rendering one of those challenges is met with tools that
already work.

PROVENANCE OF THE FIGURES BELOW
-------------------------------
This file is family core and carries measurements taken on SIBLING sites.
They are evidence about the SOLVER, not about Snapchat, and are labelled as
such so nobody re-reads them as facts about this site:

  * foodpanda-scraper, 2026-09-16: a Cloudflare Turnstile Challenge page
    solved via the `turnstile.render` interception — all four parameters
    captured, an 837-character token in 11 seconds, $0.00145, and the page
    came back as the real site.
  * foodpanda-scraper, 2026-09-16: `RecaptchaV2EnterpriseTaskProxyless` on a
    PerimeterX denial page, ~55 seconds, $0.00299. The control matters as
    much as the result — reloading that page in the same session WITHOUT
    solving cleared it 0 of 8 times, so the token is what got in.

Two things decide whether that money buys anything anywhere:

  * **the task type.** An enterprise widget solved as ordinary v2 returns a
    token the site rejects. `CaptchaChallenge.enterprise` carries the page's
    own answer — its loader, and `window.grecaptcha.enterprise` — into
    `_v2_task_for`.
  * **the variant.** A sibling's first live attempt read a bframe with no
    `size` as v3, bought a `RecaptchaV3TaskProxyless` and got
    ERROR_CAPTCHA_UNSOLVABLE after 87 seconds. v3 renders no challenge frame
    at all, so a frame present settles it as a v2 checkbox.

Detection therefore stays BROAD while spending stays NARROW:
`--solve-captcha when-blocked` is the default and counts job links before
paying, `page_flow.SOLVES_PER_PAGE` caps a page at one purchase, and
`page_flow.STATE_POLICY` — not this file — decides which state is worth
money at all.

Flow:
  1. Both detectors run and are reconciled (see reconcile_detections) to
     decide the variant: v3, v2-invisible or v2-checkbox. The parameters
     differ per variant and are not interchangeable — v3 params sent for a
     v2-invisible widget buy a token the site rejects.
  2. The challenge goes to 2captcha's API (v2 by default, legacy v1 as a
     one-shot fallback) with the parameters for that variant.
  3. The token is injected — into `g-recaptcha-response` for reCAPTCHA, or
     into `cf-turnstile-response` plus the page's own callback for Turnstile.

Often none of this is needed. Over the Scraping Browser API,
`Captcha.setAutoSolve` can clear the challenge inside the browser before this
code gets a turn — treat `Captcha.solveFinished` as the success signal and
keep this path as the fallback. This module is the path for a browser you
launched yourself.

No other captcha vendor is integrated (per spec: no competitors).

#   <captcha-widget data-version="v3" data-sitekey="6Leif..." ...>
# with the whole config in HTML attributes. Verified live on 2026-08-24, that
# element is GONE. The modal now loads
#   https://recaptcha.net/recaptcha/api.js?render=explicit
# and configures the widget entirely in JavaScript, into a
#   <div id="register-captcha" class="g-recaptcha">
# container. There is no `data-sitekey`, no inline `grecaptcha.execute(...)`,
# and no `grecaptcha.render` anywhere in the served HTML — all four things
# detect_recaptcha_v3() keys off are absent. It returns None on this page
# even though a real reCAPTCHA is present and active.
#
# The sitekey is still recoverable, but only at runtime, from two places
# that exist in the live page and not in its HTML:
#   1. window.___grecaptcha_cfg.clients — the reCAPTCHA API's own client
#      registry. Property names inside it are minified and change between
#      releases, so this walks the object looking for a value shaped like a
#      sitekey (^6L[\w-]{30,}$) rather than trusting any key name.
#   2. the reCAPTCHA iframe's `k=` query parameter — a stable, documented
#      part of the widget's URL, used as a cross-check and fallback.
#
# The same client config also carries `size`, which is what tells v3 apart
# from v2-invisible. That distinction is not cosmetic: 2captcha needs
# `version=v3` + `action` + `min_score` for one and `invisible=1` for the
# other, and sending the wrong one burns balance for a token that won't
# validate.

    `evaluate` is a callable that runs RECAPTCHA_DISCOVERY_JS in the page and
    returns the resulting dict — i.e. `page.evaluate` under Playwright,
    `driver.execute_script` under Selenium (wrap it so the arrow function is
    invoked), or an awaited `page.evaluate` under pyppeteer.

    Version inference, and why it is deliberately conservative:
      * `size == "invisible"` PLUS an interactive bframe iframe present is
        the signature of **v2-invisible**, not v3 — v3 never renders a
        challenge frame. This is what that site looked like as of
        2026-08-24, on the same sitekey that its old markup explicitly
        labelled `data-version="v3"`.
      * `size == "invisible"` with no challenge frame is treated as v3,
        which is v3's normal appearance (badge only).
      * an interactive bframe present with NO size and NO render parameter is
        a **v2 checkbox**. v3 never renders a challenge frame, so the frame
        alone rules it out. foodpanda's PerimeterX denial page is exactly
        this shape, and before this rung existed it was classified v3 and a
        solve was bought against the wrong task type.
      * a `normal`/`compact` size is a v2 checkbox.
    When the two signals disagree the ambiguity is recorded in the returned
    challenge's `kind` and in the log, rather than silently guessing — pick
    the wrong one and 2captcha returns a token the site rejects.

      * `<captcha-widget data-version="v3" data-sitekey="6Leif..."

    Supporting detail: `data-action="null"` in that markup means there is no

    passes one. An empty action fits a v2-invisible widget wearing a stale
    v3 label better than it fits working v3.

# No first-party captcha solver. Snapchat has no image or text challenge of
# its own that any capture shows, and no refusal of any kind has been
# observed from a datacentre address (2026-09-24).
#
# The captcha machinery above is kept although Snapchat has rendered no
# challenge to this repo: its own CSP permits captcha scripts, so one is
# configured (CLAUDE.md §18). Detection stays broad because which challenge
# a visitor meets depends on the exit; a detection on a page whose rows are
# already there guards nothing, which is why the default is `when-blocked`.
