diff_runs.py
-------------
Compares two output files from this project (JSON, as written by
output_writer.save) and reports what changed between them, keyed on `sku`.

    python3 diff_runs.py --old spotlight.2026-09-01.json \\
                          --new spotlight.2026-09-07.json

Typical use is a scheduled re-run kept under a dated filename, diffed against
the previous one:

    python3 playwright_scraper.py --url nasa,mrbeast --mode spotlight \\
        --out "spotlight_$(date +%F)"
    python3 diff_runs.py --old "$(ls -t spotlight_*.json | grep -v meta | sed -n 2p)" \\
                          --new "spotlight_$(date +%F).json" --out diff.json

Each mode has its own row class, so each has its own TRACKED_FIELDS, and a
pair of runs from different modes is refused (the sidecar records `mode`).

Four buckets, each keyed on sku:

  added          — sku present in --new, absent from --old: a new account in
                   the run, a new Spotlight video, a new snap
  removed        — sku present in --old, absent from --new. For `story` this
                   is ordinary — a live story expires within a day — and for
                   `spotlight` it can mean the video moved past the 25 a
                   profile page lists rather than that it was deleted.
  changed        — sku present in both, with a different tracked value.
  source_changed — kept from the family core and EMPTY here by construction:
                   every row is read from one payload, so there is no second
                   source a difference could be an artefact of.

ONE THING TO KNOW BEFORE READING A DIFF OF THIS SITE
----------------------------------------------------
**Spotlight counts move on their own.** A video's views, boosts and
comments grow while it is being watched, so two runs an hour apart
legitimately differ on almost every `spotlight` row, and `--fail-on-change`
there means "tell me when a number moved", not "tell me when something
broke". Subscriber counts are rounded by the site to the nearest hundred,
so they move in steps of 100 or not at all.

A row this project's parser could not recover a sku for (None) cannot be
matched across runs at all, so it is counted and reported separately rather
than silently folded into "added"/"removed", which would be wrong on its face.

# What is worth watching, per mode, and nothing else.
#
# EVERY NAME HERE MUST EXIST ON THE MODE'S ROW CLASS, and that is not a
# style rule. The tuple the donor of this core arrived with named 25 fields
# its row class did not have — so the diff compared nothing and reported
# "0 changed" with exit 0 on a run where a tracked value had changed. A
# monitor that cannot see the thing it monitors is worse than no monitor,
# because it reports success. `smoke_test.py` pins every name here against
# the dataclass it belongs to.
#
# DELIBERATELY NOT TRACKED, in every mode:
#
#   URLs — `profile_picture_url`, `video_url`, `media_url` and the rest.
#     They are unsigned and stable (measured 2026-09-24), but a changed
#     image is already visible as a changed CDN id in the sku of a story
#     row, and a CDN rebuild that re-issues every URL would otherwise mark
#     every row changed while nothing about the account did.
#   `position` and `page` — artefacts of the order --url named accounts.
#   `scraped_at`.
#   the ids themselves — `business_profile_id` IS the join key on a public
#     profile, so a change in it would mean the join was wrong.
